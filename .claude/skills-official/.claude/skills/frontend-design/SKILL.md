This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap
- **Backgrounds**: Create atmosphere and depth with textures, patterns, gradients

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like Inter font, purple gradients on white, or predictable layouts.
