# Writing Hookify Rules

## Overview

Hookify rules are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that define patterns to watch for and messages to show when those patterns match. Rules are stored in `.claude/hookify.{rule-name}.local.md` files.

## Rule File Format

### Basic Structure

```markdown
---
name: rule-identifier
enabled: true
event: bash|file|stop|prompt|all
pattern: regex-pattern-here
---

Message to show Claude when this rule triggers.
Can include markdown formatting, warnings, suggestions, etc.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

**name** (required): Unique identifier for the rule
- Use kebab-case: `warn-dangerous-rm`, `block-console-log`
- Be descriptive and action-oriented
- Start with verb: warn, prevent, block, require, check

**enabled** (required): Boolean to activate/deactivate
- `true`: Rule is active
- `false`: Rule is disabled (won't trigger)

**event** (required): Which hook event to trigger on
- `bash`: Bash tool commands
- `file`: Edit, Write, MultiEdit tools
- `stop`: When agent wants to stop
- `prompt`: When user submits a prompt
- `all`: All events

**pattern** (simple format): Regex pattern to match

**Example:**
```yaml
event: bash
pattern: rm\s+-rf
```
